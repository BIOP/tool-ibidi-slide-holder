# Magnetic holder for IBIDI Removable Chamber Slides
![Slide Holder Overview](https://github.com/BIOP/tool-ibidi-slide-holder/raw/main/images/Overview%20on%20Holder.jpg)

This project was made to enable imaging of IBIDI Chambers on the [PerkinElmer Operetta CLS](https://www.perkinelmer.com/uk/product/operetta-cls-system-hh16000000).
The default magnetic slide holder counter piece did not have a sufficient height for the chambers and was also not adapted to the non-symmetric nature of the removable well slides.

# Instructions
1. 3D print the piece with full infill for max stability. No particular tolerance adjustments were needed.
2. Find the right orientation of the magnets before glueing by putting the magnets on the main slide holder piece.
3. Clean the magnets with ethanol, allow to dry and glue them (mind the orientation) to the 3D printed part.

# Editable Model
The model was made using [DesignSpark Mechanical](https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/mechanical-software) and exported to stl. Both files are available in this repository.
